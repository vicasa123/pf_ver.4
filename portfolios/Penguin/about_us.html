		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<div class="about_txt">
			<h2>The one you can’t put down. The one you’ll never forget.</h2>
			<p>
				Some time ago – in 1934, to be precise – our founder was waiting for a train and couldn’t find anything good to read. What was needed, he realised, were quality books at a reasonable price. And so he decided to change things – the following year Penguin was launched, kickstarting a paperback revolution that would sweep the world.
			</p><br><br><br>
				

			<h2>The one you listened to this morning. The one you’re cooking from tonight.</h2>
			<p>
				Today, our iconic logo – originally sketched at London Zoo – can be found on bestsellers and undiscovered gems, pride of place in much-loved bookshops, neighbourhood supermarkets and almost certainly on your shelf at home. Whatever, wherever and however you like to read, we’ve got something for you.

			</p><br><br><br>

			<h2>The one that makes you laugh out loud. The one that made you sob even louder.</h2>
			<p>
				Almost a century after that train journey, in a very different world indeed, our Mission remains the same. Through decades and lifetimes, celebrations and crises, Penguin has always, always made books for everyone. Books that can change your mood or your mind. Your commute or your community. The way you eat or the way you sleep. Today, tomorrow or your entire life.
			</p><br><br><br>


			<h2>We make books for everyone, because a book can change anyone.</h2><br><br>

			<h2>Explore our publishing houses</h2>
